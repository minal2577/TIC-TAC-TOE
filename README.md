Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
This Python project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a challenging AI opponent.
You can play against the AI by making moves on the graphical user interface.
## features
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
Visually appealing game board with X and O symbols.
AI uses a minimax algorithm for strategic moves.

## Installations
This project requires Python 3 and the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip:
Bash:-
pip install pygame
## usage
Clone or download the repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the game using the following command:
Bash:-
python tic_tac_toe.py

Click on the squares on the game board to make your moves.
The AI will make its move after your turn.
## Game  PLay
 Wins are determined by completing a row, column, or diagonal with your symbol (X or O).
 The game ends in a tie if all squares are filled and no player has achieved a winning condition.
 
## Future Improvements

* Implement a two-player mode for local games against friends.
* Introduce difficulty levels for the AI to adjust the challenge.
* Add sound effects for game actions (turns, wins, etc.).
* Allow customization of game board and symbol appearances.

We welcome your suggestions and contributions to improve this project!
